# 1.1.2
- Fixed "Marukyu" incorrectly being written as "Marakyu" in a number of messages
  - This has been an issue with the mod since its 32 bit version (and was reported on the 32 bit page [here](https://github.com/ShrineFox/Persona-4-Golden-Mod-Menu/issues/33)). Idk how it was never noticed before lol

# 1.1.1
- Slightly improved support for every language (except Traditional Chinese)
  - Every language now has a MSG.TBL with the strings for "Off", "On", and "+" added to them
  - This means that the options and find a friend menu will show correctly instead of displaying placeholder values like BLANK

Note that English and Spanish are still the only languages with full support. For other languages the menus still display in English. This update just slightly improve usability of them. 
If you're interested in making a proper translation please reach out :)

When running in the Traditional Chinese language some of the mods files do not compile at all, so it's a bigger problem than the other languages and will not work at all.
